BLINK SELECTOR

- The system consists of two momentary switches and three LEDs: red,
  green, and blue.
- Exactly one LED must be active at a time, and when active,
  must toggle at one of four frequencies: 1Hz, 1.33Hz, 2Hz, or 4Hz.
- One momentary switch is used to select the active LED.
- One momentary switch is used to select the toggle frequency.
- The LED selector switch should cycle the active LED in the following
  order: RED -> GREEN -> BLUE in a repeating pattern.
- For each press of the LED selector switch, the active LED should
  advance exactly one step in the cycle.
- The frequency selector switch should cycle the toggle frequency in
  the following order: 1Hz -> 1.33Hz -> 2Hz -> 4Hz in a repeating
  pattern.
- For each press of the frequency selector switch, the toggle frequency
  should advance exactly one step in the cycle.
- All switch effects should occur on-press, not on-release.
- All switch effects should occur immediately, i.e. there must be no
  blocking behavior observed.
