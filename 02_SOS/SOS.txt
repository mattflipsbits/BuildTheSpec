SOS

- The system consists of two states: an all-clear state, indicated by a green LED,
  and an SOS state, indicated by a red LED.
- Switching between states occurs using a momentary switch.
- All-Clear State: Occurs when the momentary switch is not activated. The green
  LED cycles from full-brightness to half-brightness then returns to full-brightness.
  The full cycle should take 10 seconds and occur evenly, i.e. 5 seconds to dim to
  half-brightness and 5 seconds to return to full-brightness. The red LED is not
  illuminated during the all-clear state.
- SOS state: Occurs when the momentary switch is activated. The red LED transmits
  the "SOS" message following the ITU-R M.1667-1 recommendations. The message
  should repeat as long as the momentary switch is activated. If the momentary
  switch is deactivated while the "SOS" message is being transmitted, the message
  must be allowed to complete before returning to the all-clear state. The green
  LED is not illuminated during the SOS state.
